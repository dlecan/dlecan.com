I bring my experience and expertise to _bold_ B2C or B2B2C digital companies that want to grow _fast_ and _well_.

Depending on the context of your company, I can work as a **CTO**, **VP of Engineering** or **Senior Architect**.

I want to be in contact with users; I like to get hands "in the dirt" and problems.

### My skills
